Jackson Hole Wyoming is an exceptional ski resort due to the snow, the amazing steep and challenging terrain, the backcountry, the village, and the lift infrastructure. It’s so easy to see why so many people flock there to live and call themselves “a local”! Jackson Hole Ski Resort is so perfect that the Powderhounds would consider it to be the best US ski resort, however…and it’s a big however…. everyone knows how fabulous it is and it’s become completely over-run. On a powder day, the Jackson Hole Ski Resort can be feral, the lift lines ridiculously long, fresh powder gone in-bounds within half an hour (and gone within an hour in the sidecountry), and good luck if you need to drive or get a bus from the town of Jackson. Yet if it’s not a powder day mid-week, all the locals don’t bother turning up, and it’s a fairly peaceful ski resort. Weekends can be a different matter when lots of Ikon Pass holders arrive en masse.',
